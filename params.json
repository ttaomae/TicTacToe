{"name":"TicTacToe","tagline":"","body":"#TicTacToe\r\nThis was a project that I worked on during my free time of my final semester of my undergraduate studies. My goal was to create a simple, yet presentable program, which I could use to help me develop better software engineering practices. Another goal was to introduce myself to version control and learn the basics of Git.\r\n\r\nThis version of TicTacToe supports mouse input for one or two players. The computer uses a simple [alpha-beta pruning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) algorithm to select its move.\r\n\r\n#Additional Info\r\n\r\nFor more details about the project, see the following pages:\r\n* [User Guide](https://github.com/ttaomae/tictactoe/wiki/User-Guide)\r\n* [Developer Guide](https://github.com/ttaomae/tictactoe/wiki/Developer-Guide)\r\n* [Contact Us](https://github.com/ttaomae/tictactoe/wiki/Contact-Us)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
